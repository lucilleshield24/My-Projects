# My-Projects

This is where I am storing all the tiny projects, coding exercises, and other little bits of code I have completed. As of right now, all of these projects were created in Thonny and coded in Python. The title of each file is pretty explanatory, but I will include a brief summary of a file below if needed in the future.
